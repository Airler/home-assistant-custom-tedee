This component gives basic access to your tedee smart lock. Right now it supports to lock and unlock your tedee and pull the spring. Also it gets some additional data as attributes (battery level, charging, connected, infos about pullspring).

To use the integration you need the [tedee bridge](https://tedee.com/product-info/bridge/) connected to your lock.

## Installation

This custom component can be installed using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

*Important:* If you are a former user of [joerg65/tedee_lock](https://github.com/joerg65/tedee_lock), please uninstall it by deleting `/config/custom_components/tedee_lock` and remove the configuration from your `configuration.yaml`. You can reuse the personal access key, so you might keep it.

## Setup

This integration can work locally as well as with the tedee cloud. The local mode is the recommended way to use this integration. Depending on which properties you set during setup, the integration will work in local, cloud mode or local with cloud fallback.

| Properties set | Mode |
| --- | --- |
| `Bridge IP Address` and `Local Access Token` | Local |
| `Personal Access Key` | Cloud |
| `Bridge IP Address` and `Local Access Token` and `Personal Access Key` | Local with cloud fallback |

### Get local access token (local)
To get your Bridge IP Address and Local Access Token you have to get the Token from the tedee App. Head to your Bridge's settings -> Local API. Make sure `Encrypted token is enabled`, click the eye icon and copy the token. Below the token you can find the IP Address of your Bridge.

### Create personal access key (cloud)

See the tedee api docs to learn how to [create a personal access key](https://tedee-tedee-api-doc.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/howtos/authenticate.html#personal-access-key).

You will need these scopes:

   - Devices - Read
   - Operate - Lock

### Installation

Go to the integrations page (Configuration - Devices & Services). Click the "+ Add Integration" button in the lower left corner and look for the "tedee" integration. Insert your personal access key and click submit.

After this you should see the tedee integration on your Devices & Services page. This component creates a device for every lock with a lock entity (`lock.name_of_your_lock`).

## Configuration

You can change the following settings after setting up the integration, by going to the integration's settings and pressing the "CONFIGURE" button:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
`Personal Access Key` | You can update your personal access key should it expire soon
`Bridge IP Address` | You can update your bridge IP address should it change
`Local Access Token` | You can update your local access token should it change
`Unlock pulls latch` | If checked, a "normal" unlock of your lock will also pull the latch. This is like in the tedee App when you have the "auto-pull" enabled. (Default: Disabled)

## Roadmap

This project is open for your pull requests - just implement any feature you might need! ðŸš€

## Known issues

- The state of the lock gets updated every 10 seconds, so there is no realtime update (but it seems to be on tedees roadmap)
- If you add a lock after setup you have to restart Home Assistant to see the new device
- No real error reporting/handling
- If the tedee server is not available during Home Assistant startup the locks will not come available. You have to restart again.
