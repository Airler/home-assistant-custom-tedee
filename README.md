This component gives basic access to your tedee smart lock. Right now it supports to lock and unlock your tedee and pull the spring. Also it gets some additional data as attributes (battery level, charging, connected, infos about pullspring).

To use the integration you need the [tedee bridge](https://tedee.com/product-info/bridge/) connected to your lock.

## Installation

This custom component can be installed using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

*Important:* If you are a former user of [joerg65/tedee_lock](https://github.com/joerg65/tedee_lock), please uninstall it by deleting `/config/custom_components/tedee_lock` and remove the configuration from your `configuration.yaml`. You can reuse the personal access key, so you might keep it.

## Setup

### Create personal access key

See the tedee api docs to learn how to [create a personal access key](https://tedee-tedee-api-doc.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/howtos/authenticate.html#personal-access-key).

You will need these scopes:

   - Devices - Read
   - Operate - Lock

### Configuration

Go to the integrations page (Configuration - Devices & Services). Click the "+ Add Integration" button in the lower left corner and look for the "tedee" integration. Insert your personal access key and click submit.

After this you should see the tedee integration on your Devices & Services page. This component creates a device for every lock with a lock entity (`lock.name_of_your_lock`).

## Roadmap

This project is open for your pull requests - just implement any feature you might need! ðŸš€

## Known issues

- The state of the lock gets updated every 10 seconds, so there is no realtime update (but it seems to be on tedees roadmap)
- If you add a lock after setup you have to restart Home Assistant to see the new device
- No real error reporting/handling
- If the tedee server is not available during Home Assistant startup the locks will not come available. You have to restart again.
